        <h1>About MemeThreads</h1>
        <p>
          MemeThreads is a creative experiment turned full-stack showcase — a store built to bring
          internet humor to life through wearable art. Each shirt is designed with the same energy
          that fuels viral memes: quick, clever, and made to spark a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crafted for those who love both style and laughter, MemeThreads blends sharp design with
          everyday comfort. Whether you’re rocking a shirt at a party, gifting one to a friend, or
          just flexing your favorite inside joke, it’s built to connect people through humor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every MemeThreads product is printed with care, backed by a streamlined checkout system,
          and supported by a modern full-stack workflow. It’s more than just merch — it’s a
          portfolio project, a creative playground, and a way to show that code and comedy can
          collide in something people actually want to wear.
